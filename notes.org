* 2020-02-03: Initial results observations

With the default radius of sqrt(2) * resolution:
	Each pixel is pulling points from 56.5 m^2
		Ï€[ 3m * sqrt(2) ]^2 = 56.2 m^2

raster tilesize more efficient if multiple of 8 (16) pixels

output tiles are 1001x1001 px.  Need to shift/shrink bounds by 0.5 px.


Lot of "extra" points in class 17

AGL laz merges classes 8 and 2 into 2

* 2020-02-04: Don't overwrite job logs
	add #SBATCH --open-mode=append

* 2020-02-04: Update Class List
	Include Class 1 (Unclassified)
	Continue to drop 7 (noise) and 9 (water)
	Drop Class 10 (Water Edge - Metro, Ignored Ground - Southwest/MN River Basin)
	Drop Class 11 (Scan Edge - Metro)
	Drop Class 12 (Overlap - South East))
	Drop Class 17 (Overlap - Arrowhead, Central Lakes) 

* Need to reclass class 1 (mccloud and others have all non ground and noise and everything 1)

* Kill over 120m AGL

* Sterns class 6 are breaklines

* 2020-02-11: Replace Chisago Cty data
* 2020-02-10: TODO: output agl laz needs to be cropped to output boundary
* 2020-02-10: Chisago area is high point density
  Need to deal with this in the mkgrid.py

  Chisago has 20-33 Mpts per qq250k
  Metro medium density has 24.4 Mpts per qq
  Metro high density has 91.1 Mpts per qq

  Chisago (aside from lakes) needs 1500m and 750m processing tiles
  1500m fails at about half
  3000m fails on most

  For now try double RAM to see if will finish with 1500m tiles.

* 2020-02-12: 3.merge.sh: should setnames on vrt

* 2020-02-13: Clip HAG >= 0
